README.txt

ForgeTools is a mod for Minecraft Forge based servers which gives server 
administrators access to information about the server from in-game such as
server lag (tick rate), number of entities in each dimension, how many chunks
are force-loaded in each dimension, and information about the current dimension

ForgeTools is currently running off of Forge 6.0.1 and MCP 7.19 for Minecraft
1.4.2.  It is behind to match the development of the Feed the Beast modpack so
server managers can use it with FTB.

Minecraft Forge 6.0.1 is available at:

MCP 7.19 is available at:
